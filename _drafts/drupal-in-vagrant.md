Let's get our codebase started. Download the latest Drupal version and unpack it
into a folder with a meaningful name for your site.

    wget https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz
    tar xfzv drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz
    mv drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz my-site

Remember, you can press tab after entering part of the file name to save time.
