# How to set up a Vagrant box

I was homeless once or twice, and sleeping amidst boxes is the bomb. You don't 
want them formed into their box shape though, you need them layered above to keep
you warm, and beneath to keep you comfortable. In fact, if you're blessed to 
have a sleeping bag it's even better. But if there are mozzies about, each 
pin prick extraction of blood will pierce your soul and increase the agony of
destitution.

Making a Vagrant box is much easier than being a vagrant sleeping on boxes.

This how to guide is for setting up a Vagrant base box on a Ubuntu host. You
can do the same thing on other OS's but the commands will be different. If you
are on Ubuntu, you can simply follow along.

First up, why bother? 

There are plenty of Vagrant boxes out there, you can simply search for one that
meets your use case and download it. However, in some cases you might find that
the available boxes have installed software that you don't want, or they don't
have quite all that you do want. In the latter case, you can apply some of these
same steps to create your own box based on another base box.

For this how to guide I will focus on the specific use case of setting up a dev
box for designing drupal sites. I want to be able to start the VM and visit the
site in my browser. In a later post we will cover the additional step of deploying
the code using Vagrant push.

Let's get our codebase started. Download the latest Drupal version and unpack it
into a folder with a meaningful name for your site.

    wget https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz
    tar xfzv drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz
    mv drupal-8.3.2.tar.gz my-site

Remember, you can press tab after entering part of the file name to save time.
