# Understanding Python setuptools

Before we get into it, I just want to state my purpose. I want to contribute to
Open Source Software, in the hope of landing another paid gig as a developer. 
Having found Certbot to be extremely useful, as well as providing the benefit
of free end to end encryption for web traffic using SSL certificates, I have 
decided to try to contribute to the Certbot project.

Looking through the issues tracker I landed on an issue that was tagged with 
"Good Volunteer Task" and "Easy Fix". Alright. But before I get into modifying
and extending code, I want to understand the codebase. 

Certbot uses Python setuptools, so let's start there.
