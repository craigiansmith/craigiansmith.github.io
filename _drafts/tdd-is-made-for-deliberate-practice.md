# Knowing how to program

There are many answers here already, and the question is kind of old, but in case
this might help someone, here goes.

Studying Computer Science will give you a great grounding. And any hands on 
experience you have writing code and getting it to work is valuable, in my 
opinion. 

After studying, if you want work, as the OP did, don't forget prayer! But also,
there are many mundane things you can do to improve your employability as a
programmer. 

Developing programming skills is a priority, and letting those skills be widely
recognised will put you in a good position for landing your next job. To that end
here are two recommendations:

## Developing your skills

From Kent Beck's 2002 book, "Test Driven Development: By Example":
"TDD is an awareness of the gap between decision and feedback during programming,
and techniques to control that gap." If you have read anything about deliberate
practice which Anders Erricson presents in his book "Peak", this should get your 
ears ringing. Set yourself a small programming task, and set about it in a TDD
fashion. You'll get a tight feedback loop, and this will help you to be aware of
the progress that you make in your learning. Repeat.

## Contribute to Open Source Software

You've probably heard this admonition a bunch of times. There's a reason for it.
If you work only on proprietary code for your employer, your skill is not evident
to anyone apart from your employer and colleagues. This can be a problem if for
some reason, people are prone to doubt your abilities, say due to unfortunate
stereotyping. If, on the other hand, you have made some good contributions to
projects for which the source code is publicly available, your ability will not
be hidden so much. 

These are just two suggestions. Keep going. Try lots.
