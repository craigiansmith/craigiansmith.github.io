Security for Ubuntu

debsecan is the Debian security analyser. It compares security notices and flags
if any packages that are installed in your machine have related security notices
and also package updates.

It currently doesn't work with Ubuntu because Ubuntu security notices are tracked
elsewhere. But it would be really useful to migrate it accross.
