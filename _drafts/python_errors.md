# Deliberate practice

Part of deliberate practice is noticing mistakes via feedback, and then 
correcting them. For a developer there are many differet ways to get feedback 
about our work, and to get notified of mistakes in programming. Some of the 
simplest are syntax errors, writing code that the interpreter or compiler can't 
understand because it breaks a rule of syntax. This is the first, most obvious
type of errors. 

Syntax errors include:

In Lists and Dictionaries, all elements need to be separated by a comma.
Omitting a comma after the closing bracket of a nested list, or dictionary.
To train yourself to remember to include these trailing commas write 3 sets of
lists or dictionaries which contain at least one nested list followed by other
elements. Place the trailing comma in before running the code. If you get this
particular syntax error, try again, until you have done 3 consecutive scripts
without this error. If you make a different syntax error, note it down and come
back to it after you have mastered this one.

Using square brackets to contain group of key value pairs. This can't be done
in a list. Even when you are creating a group of several similar things, if you
wan't to give each element a name, instead of a numeric index, you can't use a
list, but you can use a dictionary.
